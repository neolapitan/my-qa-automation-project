# Welcome!

This is my sample QA automation project. I've utilized an open source website to showcase my basic QA automation skills using Cypress with TypeScript. I've used an End-to-End testing which starts from logging in to testing other parts of the website, specifically the first and second layout, and the navbar.

## Website

- https://trytestingthis.netlify.app/ (the website that I've utilized)

## Dependencies

- **NodeJS**: version **18.16.0 LTS**
- **Cypress**: version **12.13.0**
- **TypeScript**: version **5.1.3**
- **cypress-file-upload**: version **5.0.8** (to make the contents of the _attachFile()_ method work)

## Installation

1. npm install
2. npx cypress open
